 * If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words:

 * If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand inclusive)
 *  were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
 * NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 
 * 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 
 * 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. 
 * The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance 
 * with British usage.
